\section{Interest Deduction Limit (\S 163(j))}
The amount of deductible business interest expense for a taxable year is limited to the sum of:
\begin{equation}
    L = BII + (ATI \times 0.30) + FPF
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $L$: Maximum allowable interest deduction.
    \item $BII$: Business Interest Income.
    \item $ATI$: Adjusted Taxable Income.
    \item $FPF$: Floor Plan Financing interest.
\end{itemize}

\section{The 2022 Regime Shift}
The "Regime Shift" modeled in this repository concerns the definition of $ATI$.
\subsection{Pre-2022 (EBITDA Regime)}
For years beginning before January 1, 2022, $ATI$ is computed adding back depreciation, amortization, and depletion:
\begin{equation}
    ATI \approx EBITDA
\end{equation}

\subsection{Post-2022 (EBIT Regime)}
For years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the add-back for depreciation and amortization expires:
\begin{equation}
    ATI \approx EBIT = EBITDA - (Depreciation + Amortization)
\end{equation}
