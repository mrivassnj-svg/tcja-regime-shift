# TCJA Regime Shift Framework

A modular Python framework for analyzing corporate capital structure transitions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

## 🚀 The Backbone
This project identifies the "kink" in the corporate tax shield caused by the 2017 legislative shift. It allows researchers to visualize how **Capital Intensity** (measured via Depreciation & Amortization) interacts with **Interest Deductibility**.

## 🛠️ Key Components
- **`TCJAModel`**: A robust class handling float-point precision and the EBITDA-to-EBIT transition.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Dynamic simulation of debt capacity across three distinct US tax regimes.
- **Dual-Plot Visuals**: Simultaneously tracks total tax shield value and the step-function of marginal benefits.

## 📊 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/username/tcja-regime-shift.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebooks/TCJA_Regime_Shift_Framework.ipynb` to run the simulation.

This framework is for sensitivity analysis and educational purposes, not causal inference or tax advice.
